WELCOME TO CHAAL - YOUR STRATEGIC GOAL TRACKER

---------------------------------------------------
1. HOW IT WORKS
---------------------------------------------------
Chaal is designed to help you build momentum. The interface is divided into three main sections:

- The Dashboard: Your daily snapshot. See your "Next Move," your success rate, and today's wisdom ("Kuch Gyaan ki Baat").
- The Grid: Your weekly battlefield. This is where you mark your habits complete.
- The Sidebar: Your navigation and status center (check if you are "On Fire!").

---------------------------------------------------
2. THE RULES (LOGIC)
---------------------------------------------------
To keep tracking honest, Chaal follows strict time rules:
- YOU CANNOT change the past. If you missed a habit yesterday, the box is locked.
- YOU CANNOT predict the future. Upcoming days are locked with a 'Lock Icon' until that day arrives.
- YOU CAN ONLY act on today.

---------------------------------------------------
3. FEATURES & TIPS
---------------------------------------------------
* Streak Freeze (Pit Stops):
  Going on vacation or sick? Use a "Pit Stop" from the sidebar to freeze your streak so you don't lose your progress.

* Categories:
  Habits are grouped (e.g., Mindfulness, Skill). Keep your list balanced between work and rest.

* On Fire:
  Maintain a 7-day streak to unlock the "On Fire" status.
