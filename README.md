Project Name: Chaal – Strategic Habit Tracking Dashboard

Overview: Chaal is a React-based, productivity application designed to bridge the gap between simple to-do lists and complex project management tools. Built with a focus on UI/UX clarity, the interface utilizes a coherent purple monochrome palette to reduce cognitive load and enhance focus.

UX Highlights:

Dashboard-First Design: Users are greeted with a "Command Center" view, displaying daily tasks, streak metrics, and motivational content in a single viewport.

Visual Feedback Loops: Utilizes progress bars, success rate percentages, and streak badges (e.g., "On Fire!") to provide instant dopamine rewards for task completion.

Cultural Personalization: Includes a "Kuch Gyaan ki Baat" (Words of Wisdom) component, adding a layer of personality and cultural grounding to the user experience.
